== SecureCam - Camera Security System

Author: Tyler Hyndman
Email: tyler.hyndman@gmail.com

== About

This project is a web interface used to view recorded videos taken
with the Linux command line program motion.  It is still very much
a work in progress.

== Dependencies

Need a working web server with PHP5, MySQL5, and the program motion
installed.

Documentation for montion can be found at
<http://www.lavrsen.dk/twiki/bin/view/Motion/WebHome>

== Installation (Working on making this easier)

1.) Download, extract and place where desired on webserver.
2.) Create a MySQL database named securecam and run database.sql
3.) Insert cameras into MySQL database
4.) Open index.php on webserver
5.) Fill out MySQL information and create username and password
    for web interface.
6.) Copy motion.conf and thread*.conf to /etc/motion/motion.conf
7.) Edit the thread*.conf file so that target_dir is
    /path/to/securecam/snapshots/cameraXX, webcam_port is unique,
    and the last number in the script args for on_movie_start and
    on_picture_save are the number of the camera.
8.) Run motion from command line and it will start recording motion!
